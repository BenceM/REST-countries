## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode
- Should be optimised for 375px, 1440px screens

### My Approach

I wanted to build this app using nothing, but plain HTML, CSS and Javascript. I took a mobile first approach. First created the HTML and the template for the countries, then the layout and styling, lastly the Javascript. Once that was done, I moved onto creating the individual country modals, using the same approach.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JS (ES6)
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Ion Icons](https://ionic.io/ionicons) - For Icons

### What I learned

This project became much larger, than I anticipated. I've learnt and practiced a lot, here are a few things I practiced:

- CSS layouts and styling (grid, flexbox)
- API call with async/await
- API response handling
- Object iterations
- Array iterations
- Optional chaining (?.)
- Nullish coalescing operator (??)
- Intersection Observer

Example:

```js
const parent =
	e.target.closest(".country") ??
	countriesArr
		.filter(
			(el) =>
				el.querySelector(".country-name").textContent.toLowerCase() ===
				e.target.textContent.toLowerCase()
		)
		.pop();
```

```js
data[country].tld?.join(" ") ?? "None";
```

### Continued development

I didn't anticipate the code size to be this large, it would be wiser to divide my CSS and JS into multiple files and use a code architecture like MVC.
Also I would like to take on a more non-mutating approach, when it comes to JS functions.

Going forward I'd like to implement:

- Code Architecture
- Frameworks
- Simpler function designs

Possible further improvements:

- Making it Translator friendly by not using .textContent for lookups (Filter/ Search / Modal)
- Optimising the API call

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - I spent most of my time reading through documentation on MDN.
